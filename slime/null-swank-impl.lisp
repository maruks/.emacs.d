;; The "SWANK-IMPL" package contains functions that access the naughty
;; bits of the Lisp implementation, such as debugger or compiler
;; internals.  In an ideal world, each function in this package would
;; be a thin wrapper around a public interface defined by the vendor
;; that massages the input/output into the format we need.
;;
;; Additionally, there is nothing Slime-specific about the functions
;; in this module---ilisp could use this as a portability layer, for
;; example.
;;
;; This is the simplest possible SWANK-IMPL implementation; it signals
;; unimplemented errors for all exported entry points.  When porting
;; Swank to new Lisp implementations, start by copying this interface.
;;
;; Open Issues:
;;
;; We need to work out exactly what "source position designators" are;
;; for now I'm assuming the plists that we use currently---is it worth
;; formalizing that into a class that we flatten to/from a plist
;; during transmission to Emacs?  What about the plists used for frame
;; locals?
;;
;; Currently there is some duplicate functionality in the compiler
;; note and xref source position plist stuff.  It might be useful to
;; merge both these things into the aforementioned position
;; designators.
;;
;; There is some inconsistency about when the functions in this module
;; return nil or signal a not-implemented-error---I think what's in
;; here is the right thing but it may be worth specifying precisely
;; for each exported function whether it must return a meaningful
;; value or not.
;;
;; Many of these functions have the same name as the slimefuns defined
;; in swank.lisp---this is okay but the intent is not to use the
;; functions defined here as the slimefuns; instead the entry points
;; should package-qualify calls into SLIME-IMPL (or we could rename
;; everything).
;;
;; I haven't attempt to refactor the inspector in the CMU backend.
